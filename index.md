## About Tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe (aka *noughts and crosses* or *Xs and Os*) is a pen-and-paper game that requires two players taking turns filling in the fields in the 3x3 grid with Xs or Os. The winner is a player who puts down three same marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. There are a number of Tic-tac-toe variants, such as [Ultimate Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe), [3D Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_tic-tac-toe), or [Wild Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_tic-tac-toe).

## Before you start

### Find and prepare

* Find one person to play with.
* Prepare a pensil (or something else you can use for putting down X/O marks on the board) and a piece of paper (or something that you can use for drawing your grid and marks).

### Decide and select

With the other player, decide

* What mark (X or O) initiates the first game
* Who of you is going to use X and who is going to use O.

### Rules of the game

Here are Tic-tac-toe player's actions:

1. Player who selected the game-initiating mark (as [agreed before the game](#decide-and-select)) starts by drawing a grid and puting down the first mark.
2. Players take turns marking empty fields in the grid with their selected symbols (Xs or Os).
3. Players iterate step 2 until

   * One of the players puts down the third same symbol in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), which means that player's victory.

     > As a winner, the player crosses out the lucky row, stampling the grid as closed.

   * There are no more free spaces in the grid, which mean a draw.

4. Before the players start another game, they rotate the initiating mark so that the same player does not start two consecutive games.
5. Players iterate steps 1 - 4 as long as they feel like playing.
