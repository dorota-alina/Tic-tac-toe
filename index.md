## About Tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe (aka *noughts and crosses* or *Xs and Os*) is a pen-and-paper game that requires two players taking turns filling in the fields in the 3x3 grid with Xs or Os. The winner is a player who puts down three same marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. There are a number of Tic-tac-toe variants, such as [Ultimate Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe), [3D Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_tic-tac-toe), or [Wild Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_tic-tac-toe).

## Before you start

### Find and prepare

* Find one person to play with.
* Prepare a pensil (or something else you can use for putting down X/O marks on the board) and a piece of paper (or something that you can use for drawing your grid and marks).

### Decide and select

With the other player, decide

* What mark (X or O) initiates the first game
* Who of you is going to use X and who is going to use O.

Let's play!

## Rules of the game

### Player's actions

1. Player who selected the game-initiating mark (as [agreed before the game](#decide-and-select)) starts by drawing a grid and putting down the first mark.
2. Players take turns marking empty fields in the grid with their selected symbols (Xs or Os).
3. Players iterate step 2 until the end of the round, which is when either

   * One of the players [wins](#end-of-the-game) by putting down the third same symbol in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and crossing it out to stamp the grid as closed
     
     OR
     
   * There are no more free spaces in the grid, which mean a [draw](#end-of-the-game).

4. Before the players start another game, they rotate the initiating mark so that the same player does not start two consecutive games.
5. Players iterate steps 1 - 4 as long as they feel like playing.

### End of the game

The game can complete with a win/lose or a draw.

> Tic-tac-toe is a solved game: It's possible to predict a draw if both players follow best possible playing scenarios.

## Tips and tricks

* Just play along: You will discover your best playing scenarios shortly.
* You can increase you chances to win the game if you're the one who starts.
* When deciding where to place your mark and not able to find a 3-same-mark-row option, at least try to prevent the other player from winnig by blocking their three-same-mark rows, if any. You can do that by placing your mark next to two same consecutive marks of the other player.
